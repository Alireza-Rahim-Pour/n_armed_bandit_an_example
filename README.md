this is a project to investigate the performance of greedy, epsilon-greedy and softmax search algorithms.
an slot machine consisting of 10 arms each with gaussian distributaion and different mean values is composed
algorithms are put to test by the objective of maximiing their gain via choosing the prefered arm
